INTRODUCTION

    It can generate a file which is including the information of block's position and block's power.

VERSION

1.0: 1. implemented data input, output and process 

1.1: 1. add some judgment function to make sure that there isn't worry in I/O operating;
     2. add some "useless" file such as readme; 
     3. record some test file in test directory;

2.0: 1. change the input function to avoid the error happened in the different of file end between Windos and liunx; 
     2. rewrite Makefile, and add debug mode and release mode:
        1. default mode is release mode 
        2. if you want to change mode using following commandsï¼š 
            #make mode = "debug" or "release"
     3. solve the problem that the upper and right boundary is not consided;
     4. add a judgment function to judge if the output is worry obviously; 
    

INSTALLATION

1. unzip and untar the file using following commands
    tar -zxvf xiaaohw1_final.tar.gz

2. go to the installation dirction
    cd homework1/

3. build program
    make

4. run program
    ./main -c config.txt -p power.txt 

5. To remove all the outputs of compilation , type "make clean". 

USING 

this program has the following files:

0. Makefile - for building program

1. input.c and input.h -read parameters from input files 

2. output.c and output.h -write outcomes to output files

3. process.c and process.h -calulate with the parameters from input

4. main.c

run the program with following commands:

    ./main -c <config file> -p <power file> -o <output file>
    -c and -p is necessary, but -o isn't. If there isn't output file the default file is output.txt.

LIMITATION

This program can only be used in each block is the same.
